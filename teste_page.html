    <p>Hi, I am Felippe, a 29 years old oceanographer from São Paulo, Brazil. When I was 19, I
        moved to Rio Grande, far south of Brazil, to study my main course and passion, Oceanography, at the
        Federal University of Rio Grande - FURG. In this course, we have subjects from the Chemistry,
        Biology, Geology and Physics Field. I chose Physical Oceanography to continue my path, which
        was the start of my journey into programming and technology.
    </p>
    <p>During my undergrad period, I had the opportuniy to have a Scholarship sponsored by the National
        Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq - Brazil) to study in Adelaide, Australia, for 15
        months. More than an incredible academic moment, it was also a amazing personal and cultural
        experience in my life. In my period at the University of
        South Australia - UniSA, I studied subjects related with Environmental Sciences along two semesters.
        At the end of my exchange period, I was awarded
        with a Summer Scholarship from the Australian Research Council - Centre of Excellence for Climate
        System Science, when I then moved to Sydney to be a intern during 6 weeks at the Climate Change
        Reserch
        Centre (CCRC), in
        the University of New South Wales (UNSW).
    </p>
    <p>Back in Brazil, I finished my degree and went back to São Paulo to work as a Data Analyst in a
        Digital Marketing Consultancy Agency. It was a challenge to be in such a different working
        environment, outside the academy. However, it was also a great opportunity for my professional
        development. Such job contributed to increasing my tech skills: I learned new technologies, key
        concepts of Business, company’s routine and, how to work in a data team.</p>
    <p> Nowadays, in addition to my work, I spend my time studying and learning both technologies and
        oceanography/environmental sciences... Before the covid-19 and pandemic, I used to run, practice
        archery and was
        starting to climb (indoor), but since March is just books, Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube... And
        Google Meets with my friends :).
